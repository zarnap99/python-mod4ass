#Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?


#question:14#
#How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception classes: 

#question:15#
#When will the else part of try-except-else be executed? 
The else part is executed when no exception occurs

#question:16#
#Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception? 

#question:17#
#When is the finally block executed?

#question:18#
#What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?
It simply evaluates to False and does not raise any exception.
